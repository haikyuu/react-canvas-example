This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project showcases using canvas in [react](https://github.com/facebook/react).
State management is handled by the amazing [mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx), and [konva](https://github.com/konvajs/konva) is used for canvas.
